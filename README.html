<p>Please create a small responsive web site that contains the following;</p>

<p>Header &amp; Footer
Primary navigation bar with the following link titles;</p>

<pre><code>• Link 1
• Link 2
• Awkward Long link
• Link 3
• Link 4

• The menu bar should be displayed in a unbroken horizontal line, unless the screen width is too narrow, in which case an expanding container should be used
• Secondary navigation bar with 8 links (Item 1 to Item 8)
• Should remain fixed on page as user scrolls
• Should be displayed off-canvas in a vertical list when it doesn’t fit viewport width
</code></pre>

<p>Content area with:</p>

<pre><code>• A grid of images (at least 8, no upper limit) with random ‘feature’ images that are larger than the standard images 
• 3 columns of text (lorem ipsum is fine for this) when screen width allows, and a suitable display when the screen width is too narrow
</code></pre>
